## Large Language Model Policy  
This course forbids the usage of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, as you prepare your submission of homeworks, quizzes, and the final project. Your homework may be examined by the LLM detectors to detect the usage of LLM models. The violation of this policy will be treated as cheating or plagiarism, and will be reported to the [Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR)](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/).  

## Grading Scale
This class is graded according to a set curve. Final grades will be distributed through a comparison among students based on the assignments outlined.

## Attendance Policy
This course follows Purdue’s academic regulations regarding attendance, which states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class and lateness will be noted. When conflicts or absences can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible. For unanticipated or emergency absences when advance notification to the instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by email or phone. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with the instructor’s department because of circumstances beyond the student’s control, and in cases falling under excused absence regulations, the student or the student’s representative should contact or go to the [Office of the Dean of Students website](https://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absences.html) to complete appropriate forms for instructor notification. Under academic regulations, excused absences may be granted for cases of grief/bereavement, military service, jury duty, and parenting leave. For details, see the  [Academic Regulations & Student Conduct section](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=13&navoid=15965#a-attendance) of the University Catalog website. 

Guidance on class attendance related to COVID-19 are outlined in the [Protect Purdue Pledge for Fall 2021](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/) on the Protect Purdue website.

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person is threatening the safety of others by not complying with Protect Purdue protocols is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the [Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/). See also [Purdue University Bill of Student Rights](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights) and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace. 

## Academic Guidance in the Event a Student is Quarantined/Isolated
If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via Purdue email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. Please note that, according to [Details for Students on Normal Operations for Fall 2021](https://protect.purdue.edu/updates/purdue-announces-additional-details-for-students-on-normal-operations-for-fall-2021/) announced on the Protect Purdue website, “individuals who test positive for COVID-19 are not guaranteed remote access to all course activities, materials, and assignments.”


## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling 765-494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. 

Any action that might give a student unfair advantage on homework or exams will be considered as academic dishonesty. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Communicating with others during the quizzes;

- Record and distribute the quiz materials and homework solutions;

- Requesting a re-grade of work that has been altered;

- Submitting work that is not your own.

If you work with another student on a homework, you must acknowledge the person(s) by writing their names on your submission. Regardless if you have worked with another classmate, you must write your own solution. **Write your own solution** means you write in your own words, write your own program, make your own plots. If we see two identical homework, both parties will receive zero.

Cheating in homework and exams will receive penalties including, but not limited to, partial or no credit for the respective work, and / or failing the course.

All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities for review at the university level, and will result in punishment. Possible punishments include, but are not limited to, a score of zero on work related to the cheating incident, a failing grade for the course, and, in severe cases, expulsion from the university.
