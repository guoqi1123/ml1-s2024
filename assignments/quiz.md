# Quizzes
There will be five quizzes, and the worst one will be dropped. Each quiz is 40 minutes long. Each quiz will carry 8%. The quizzes are conducted in the class right after the due date of the homework. Please bring your laptop to class, as the quiz will be on Gradescope. During the quiz, I will ask you lecture questions. I will also ask you homework questions. For example, if in the homework I ask you to plot a figure, I may ask you to change a parameter and re-plot the figure. Quizzes will be open-book, open-note, open-computer. However, with only 40 minutes, you probably will not have time to read anything besides answering the questions. So, please do the homework. On the contrary, if you attend the lecture and do your homework, you will find 40 mins to be much more than enough for the quiz.
